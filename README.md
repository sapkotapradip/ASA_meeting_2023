10 environments and 5 models
materials and methods were from Fonseca et al. 2021; https://acsess.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/tpg2.20127
10 environments

18COL= 2018 Colby
18CS= 2018 College Station
18GC= 2018 Garden City
18RF = 2018 Rio Farms
18VC = 2018 Victoria
19COL = 2019 Colby
19CS = 2019 College Station
19HAY = 2019HAYS
19TA = 2019 Taft
19VC = 2019 Victoria

#Single environment models
MODEL 1: Additive and dominance efeects of genomic markers
MODEL 2: First derivative of NIR
MODEL 3: Second derivative of NIR
MODEL 4 : MODEL 1 + MODEL2
MODEL 5 : MODEL 1 + MODEL3

Above models were extended to predict across environments by including G X E and NIR X E in the models wherever needed !
All the codes will be available in publication.
